# Classification of Polymers

Polymers cannot be classified under one category because of their complex structures, different behaviours and vast applications. We can, therefore, classify polymers based on the following considerations.

## Classification of Polymers based on the Source of Availability

There are three types of classification under this category, namely, Natural, Synthetic, and Semi-synthetic Polymers.

### Natural Polymers

They occur naturally and are found in plants and animals. For example proteins, starch, cellulose, and rubber. To add up, we also have biodegradable polymers which are called biopolymers.
Semi-synthetic Polymers:
They are derived from naturally occurring polymers and undergo further chemical modification. For example, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate.

### Synthetic Polymers

These are man-made polymers. Plastic is the most common and widely used synthetic polymer. It is used in industries and various dairy products. For example, nylon-6, 6, polyether’s etc.

## Classification of Polymers based on the Structure of the Monomer Chain

This category has the following classifications.

### Linear Polymers

The structure of polymers containing long and straight chains fall into this category. PVC, i.e. poly-vinyl chloride is largely used for making pipes and electric cables is an example of a linear polymer.

### Branched-chain Polymers

When linear chains of a polymer form branches, then, such polymers are categorized as branched chain polymers. For example, Low-density polythene.

### Cross-linked Polymers

They are composed of bifunctional and trifunctional monomers. They have a stronger covalent bond in comparison to other linear polymers. Bakelite and melamine are examples in this category.

# Other Ways to Classify Polymers

## Classification Based on Polymerization

### Addition Polymerization

Example, poly ethane, Teflon, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

### Condensation Polymerization

Example, Nylon -6, 6, perylene, polyesters.

## Classification Based on Monomers

### Homomer

In this type, a single type of monomer unit is present. For example, Polyethene

### Heteropolymer or co-polymer

It consists of different type of monomer units. For example, nylon -6, 6

## Classification Based on Molecular Forces

### Elastomers

These are rubber-like solids weak interaction forces are present. For example, Rubber.

### Fibres

Strong, tough, high tensile strength and strong forces of interaction are present. For example, nylon -6, 6.

### Thermoplastics

These have intermediate forces of attraction. For example, polyvinyl chloride.

### Thermosetting polymers

These polymers greatly improve the material’s mechanical properties. It provides enhanced chemical and heat resistance. For example, phenolics, epoxies, and silicones.
